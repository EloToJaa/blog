    I am an experienced software engineer. I like to explore different
    technologies and try out different tools. I am familiar with many
    programming languages. I like to participate in CTF competitions with my
    team StormChasers as well as in competetive programming competitions. I also
    love teaching other people programming and cybersecurity.
